description: "I wanted to make a blog for two years now and never got around to it, but here it is now. There used to be a time where people would make websites for the sake of making websites. Well, here's my website, for the sake of it. I wish I did this two years ago because I have so many images I wish I could share, but I think the moments passed. Heres a few of my favorites from my 2-F though, I think that's recent enough to suffice. Maybe those other ones will see the light of day someday too. Hey, pretty cool semester though, all things considered."
